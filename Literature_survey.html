				<h2>Literature survey</h2>
				<p>
				With the development of information technology people have cast themselves to use new technologies to find solutions for problems in their day to day life. This revolutionary development has a considerable influence over education field. Currently the technology has reached even grade one students in the form of e-learning. Children tend to practice self-learning via such learning tools besides of what they are being taught by teachers.
Natural Language Processing is a highly advanced area which shows a rapid amelioration. Under that Question Answering systems plays a vital role. 

					</p>
				<p>
				
				When building a system to perform a task in Natural Language Processing, main key barriers are making computers intelligent to understand  Natural Languages. In this project we are going to apply some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the Sinhala language to gain a better understanding of the language in an NLP perspective and as a step towards developing more complex tools for arithmetic problem solving in Sinhala. Most of the available systems’ task that a question answering system realizes is given a question and collection of documents and finds the exact answer for the question. Apart from that highly intelligent Question Answering systems such as IBM watson focus on content extraction, but it does not support mathematical problem solving. Currently there are certain systems which are capable of solving mathematical problems in English such as ARIES. There is a deficiency in a such a system which can perform an arithmetic mathematical problem solving task in Sinhala language.

				<P>
				In this project we explore ways of gaining insight into question answering system performance
