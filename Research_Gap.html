				<h2>Research Gap</h2>
				<p>Although there are many advanced related systems for question answering systems in 
				English language most of them are available for information retrieval only, simply they 
				access the document and get the answers for the questions. In this proposed system our 
				main target to solve mathematical problems in Sinhala language. It is not a kind of 
				information retrieving .identifying the mathematical question is a difficult task we 
				supposed to archive this goal and every job is done through the neural network.
				
				Question Answering is a specialized form of Information Retrieval which seeks knowledge. 
				Proposed mathematical problem solving system that is capable of understanding a detailed 
				sentence mathematical problem in Sinhala language. Main research problem  is have to come up
				with a solution to understand the Sinhala language of the system and to analyze it and come up
				with an algorithm to build questions in the correct Sinhala grammar format. And the other thing
				is providing the question to the user will be done by displaying it on the screen. To make this
				possible, we should make the system to read the Sinhala language and also to understand the answer
				given by the user .we are planning to summarize Sinhala context that is given to the system. 
				
                The focus of this action research is mathematics problem solving in Sinhala so we have to identify
				which problem solving methods students choose to solve a problem. The purpose of this study is to 
				determine if students solve math problems using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
				consistently and whether students transfer these skills to other mathematical situations and solutions.
				In this action research study, a classroom of 5th grade mathematics students was used to investigate
				how students solve word problems and how they determine which mathematical approach to use to solve 
				a problem. It was discovered that many of the students read and re-read a question before they try 
				to find an answer. Most students will check their answer to determine if it is correct and makes sense.
				Most students agree that mastering basic math facts is very important for problem solving and prefer 
				mathematics that does not focus on problem solving. As a result of this research, it will be emphasized 
				to the building principal and staff the need for a unified and focused curriculum with a scope and 
				sequence for delivery that is consistently followed.
